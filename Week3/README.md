###### Lab 1: InheritanceTest 
Write a program called InheritanceTest1.java to support an inheritance hierarchy for 
class Point–Square–Cube. Use Point as the superclass of the hierarchy. Specify the instance 
variables and methods for each class. The private data of Point should be the x-y coordinates, the 
private data of Square should be the sideLength, and the private data of Cube should be depth. 
Provide applicable accessor methods, mutator methods, toString() methods, area() method, and 
volume() method to all classes. Write a program that instantiates objects of your classes, tests all 
instance methods, and outputs each object’s area and volume when appropriate.

###### Lab 2: InheritanceTest2 (50 points)
Implement an inheritance hierarchy for Account class, Checking Account class, and Savings 
Account class. CheckingAccount class has a special field called withdrawFee and 
SavingAccount has a special field called interestRate. Write a program that instantiates objects of 
all your classes, tests all instance methods, and display the balance of each account.
