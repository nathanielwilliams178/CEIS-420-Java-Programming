###### Lab1 (50 points) 
Create a class called Retangle.java that contains two double-precision instance variables named  width and height. The class should include all kinds of overloaded constructors. Additionally, there should be two accessor methods, mutator methods, class method named area() that returns the area of a Rectangle object. Inside main(),fully test all methods.
###### Lab2 (50 points)
Create a program called Date.java with all kinds of overloaded constructors. In addition, have the 
set() mutator method to perform error-checking on the properties month, day, and year. Also, 
provide a method increaseByOneDay() to increment the day by one.
Write a program called DateTest.java and have the increaseByOneDay() method tested in a loop 
of at least 100 iterations . 
Test the following cases:
a.   Incrementing into the next month
b.   Incrementing into the next year
