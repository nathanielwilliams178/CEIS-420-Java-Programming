###### Week 1 
#### Create a sales tracking Java program named SalesTracking.java. This program will use arrays to store and process monthly sales as well as compute average yearly sales, total sales for the year, and which month had the highest sales and which month had the lowest sales. You should use parallel arrays. Your first array (monthArray) should be initialized with all of the months. This array should have 12 locations of course. Your other array should be named monthlySales. Like your monthArray, this array should be 12 locations that store the amount of sales for each month. The program should prompt the user for the sales for each month starting with January. The arrays (monthlySales and monthArray) should be created in main and passed to the methods as needed. All methods should be STATIC therefore no object will need to be instantiated to call them. All methods must be called from the main method. Sales amounts should be rounded to two decimal places. You should demonstrate the use of loop and decision structures also.
